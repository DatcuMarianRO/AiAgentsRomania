# Implementation Summary

This document provides an overview of the implementation of the AI Agents Romania platform, focusing on the minimal viable backend and frontend.

## Project Structure

The project follows a monorepo architecture with the following structure:

```
/
├── backend/           # Express API server
├── frontend/          # Next.js web application
├── shared/            # Shared types, schemas, and constants
├── scripts/           # Utility scripts
├── docs/              # Documentation
└── package.json       # Root package.json with workspace config
```

## Backend Implementation

The backend is an Express.js application written in TypeScript, which provides the following features:

### Core Components

1. **Health Check System**
   - Endpoint at `/health` that monitors Redis and Supabase connections
   - Returns detailed status information for system monitoring
   - Provides service-specific error information for troubleshooting

2. **API Routes**
   - RESTful endpoints at `/api/v1`
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Rate limiting for API protection

3. **Authentication**
   - JWT-based authentication with access and refresh tokens
   - Secure cookie management
   - Token rotation for enhanced security

4. **Database Integration**
   - Supabase integration with Row Level Security
   - Database initialization script
   - Health check table for monitoring

5. **Caching**
   - Redis-based caching system
   - Improved performance for frequently accessed data
   - Reduced costs for external API calls

6. **API Documentation**
   - Swagger UI at `/docs`
   - Interactive API testing
   - Comprehensive endpoint documentation

## Frontend Implementation

The frontend is a Next.js 14 application with App Router, built with React and TypeScript:

### Core Components

1. **Landing Page**
   - Modern, responsive design
   - Call-to-action sections
   - Feature highlights

2. **Authentication**
   - Login and registration forms
   - Password reset functionality
   - Protected routes for authenticated users

3. **Dashboard**
   - User profile management
   - Agent usage statistics
   - Credit balance display

4. **Marketplace**
   - Browse and search AI agents
   - Filter by category and price
   - Agent detail pages

5. **State Management**
   - Zustand for global state
   - React Query for API data fetching
   - Custom hooks for shared functionality

6. **UI Components**
   - Tailwind CSS for styling
   - shadcn/ui component library
   - Custom animated components with GSAP

## Shared Code

The shared directory contains code that is used by both the frontend and backend:

1. **Types**
   - TypeScript interfaces for domain entities
   - API request and response types
   - Consistent type definitions across codebase

2. **Schemas**
   - Zod validation schemas
   - Shared validation logic
   - Type inference from schemas

3. **Constants**
   - API routes
   - Authentication settings
   - Feature flags

## Running the Application

To run the application in development mode:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
# Copy .env.example files in both frontend and backend directories

# Run both frontend and backend concurrently
npm run dev
```

This will start the backend server on port 3001 and the frontend application on port 3000.

## Next Steps

1. Enhance authentication system with social logins and MFA
2. Implement Stripe integration for payments
3. Develop agent creation and customization interface
4. Add analytics and monitoring system
5. Expand test coverage for critical components
